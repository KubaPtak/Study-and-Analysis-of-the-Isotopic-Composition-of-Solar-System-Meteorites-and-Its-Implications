Isotopic Dating
The knowledge of the half-life of a given radioactive element allows for determining the age of various objects. The isotopic dating method is based on the law of radioactive decay. It involves determining the number of nuclei in a given sample that have decayed, which, in turn, enables the estimation of the sample's formation time.
